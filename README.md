# pas2-csharp-edit-distance

Calculate Levenshtein distance with linear row storage.

Part of **Pas2 Polyglot** by [1Pas2](https://github.com/1Pas2): independent small projects in PHP, Python, Go and C#. No runtime dependencies outside the language standard library. Initial version: 0.1.0.

## Requirements and installation

.NET SDK 10 / net10.0. Add a project reference to `src/Library.csproj` from your application. Optional packaging: `dotnet pack src/Library.csproj -c Release`. NuGet publication was not performed.

## Example

```csharp
using Pas2.EditDistance;

Console.WriteLine(EditDistance.Between("kitten", "sitting"));
```

## API and limits

EditDistance.Between(left,right) uses unit-cost insertions, deletions and substitutions. Matching is case-sensitive over UTF-16 code units, not Unicode graphemes; supplementary characters occupy two units. O(m*n) time and O(min(m,n)) storage. No transposition operation or similarity threshold.

## Tests and example

From the repository root:

```sh
dotnet build src/Library.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project tests/Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project examples/Examples.csproj -c Release
```

Tests use the standard library or a dependency-free executable check harness. A failing assertion exits nonzero. The example is self-contained and uses local in-memory or temporary data. CI runs the same checks on Linux. No registry releases, downloads, users or production deployments are claimed.
